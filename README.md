# spectOS project

Is a simple class based implementation of how spectrophotometer handle buttons and inputs and shows output, It is only a simulation and is not real os of an spectrophotometer. our task is simulating spectrophotometer os to use in larger projects.

## Hints

### how to develop

Rules to develop these codes:

1. Write encapsulated classes representing each part of system to create complete os.
2. Write test case for them according to development document.
3. Commit every single change rather than huge pull requests.
